0,'Til Death Do Us Unite,'Til Death Do Us Unite,Sodom,"I feel a rifle bullet bore into my heart A sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood I see the glory shining light of paradise And insincerities, forever left behind  'Til death do us unite  I see the mournful flowers fading on my grave And all my friends are crying to god my soul to save Hateful faces spitting on my last resting place And all my foes are praying to hell my mind to take  I hear the echos of your prayers and your lies Your falseness and your greed mendacious sorry sights My hopes are buried by my broken dignity Still god will bless and curse us all To all eternity"

3,(Never) Say Goodbye,Return,The Impossibles,"Some summer Sunday Drifting between sleep and waking Your absence brought me to Sick feelings filled me Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss, Motionless We never said goodbye When we gave in, but we don't mind If we never say goodbye, There'll be no end, there'll be no end  Stream of consciousness Leads me to drowning dreams Looking up, you're colored baby-blue The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in, Remember then, remember when you let me in Hold on, hold on, we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other"
4,(No More) Paddy's Lament,Float,Flogging Molly,"Wipe the blood from your lip With the flesh of your hand Theres no thorn in the side left to grow So lets cherish the names that we lost for an age With the rue now the supper must go Where traditions they blend lives a home on the mend The grass glistens now for alls eyes So lets sever the shame we have come to reclaim With the waters retreat feel the shore for us Woth the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore   Don't look back For whats dead now is safe The exiled, a home where the soul kept safe Take me back on the crest of a wave No more tears for you paddy's lament No more tears No more paddy's Lament  Rip the greet from his heart Theres no sorrow tonight For once banished dreams sleep divine Where the silence you hear is the prosper we shared The only blade is a razor sharp smile Still the church bell rings the collective sings that still roam But the only thing left is the pain of nothing once more    Grab the leaf of the branch from the tree in the ground Where the roots claimed the earth many tioled To a land that now stands under no-ones command And her beauty let no man destroy So remember the gun and the damage it's done The last drop as been spilled for you and I Let there be no despair for the rule we once shared Brush the tear from the eye that still shines  Where the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore    No more tears No more paddy's Lament"
5,(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,The Clash [US],The Clash,"Midnight to six man For the first time from Jamaica Dillinger and Leroy Smart Delroy Wilson, your cool operator  Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae With backing bands sound systems And if they've got anything to say There's many black ears here to listen  But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right Charging from the bass knives to the treble But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel Onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel  Dress back jump back, this is a bluebeat attack 'Cause it won't get you anywhere Fooling with the guns The British Army is waiting out there An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons  White youth, black youth Better find another solution Why not phone up Robin Hood And ask him for some wealth distribution  Punk rockers in the UK They won't notice anyway They're all too busy fighting For a good place under the lighting  The new groups are not concerned With what there is to be learned They got Burton suits, ha, you think it's funny Turning rebellion into money  All over people changing their votes Along with their overcoats If Adolf Hitler flew in today They'd send a limousine anyway  I'm the all night drug-prowling wolf Who looks so sick in the sun I'm the white man in the Palais Just lookin' for fun  I'm only Looking for fun  I'm only Looking for fun"

8,10 Years Of Service,"Live on Lansdowne, Boston MA",Dropkick Murphys,"The status of our future in both past and present time, Is relegated to a member of a higher class than mine. To Determine and direct the lives of family men who bear the burden Of living up to standard that doesn't exist in 1999    Who's gonna save us from this lonely picket line, 10 years of service but I'm still not worth your time. And I've seen men give their lives, And heard the stories that they tell of how they labored For this company which sold it's soul to hell  Times may be changing but I'll never leave behind the hopes And thoughts I have of better days for families such as mine. Because if history repeats itself and time will surely tell. What goes around will come around and you'll know our pain too well."

Still pending and wishing now on every star in the sky That everything would be alright Falling down to your knees With promises that you'd intended to keep What good are the words we speak?  Perhaps some other time when everything's in place When all the stars align reveling all the answers that we seek That place where violence will not fix everything Does it fix anything? Can you tell me?  What you waiting for? What you waiting for? What you waiting for?  Sinking in the sand, a revelation that you had So long it goes, away now clouded by the smoke That place were happiness and broken dreams align And become the life that you seek It was all that you needed  Perched in the corner with your hand on your ears To stop the dribbling of words that keep on pouring out in fear Finding yourself at the end of the race or merely falling behind Can you tell me? What you waiting for?  What you waiting for? What you waiting for? What you waiting for?  Can you? Can you tell me?"

62,Again,Two,Earshot,As I ponder my Thoughts and fears and life I stand tempted to throw it all away So I sit and I Slowly lose my mind Look for signs of you Just to feel it again  Need to find my way back home again A place where I can feel myself again Leave the world behind and start again Need to find my way back home again  As I gather myself I know that I Still stand tempted to throw it all away So I sit and I Watch the world pass by Look for signs of you Just to feel it again  Another lonely day As the sunlight turns to haze I'm calling you to say I miss you I'm OK It's hard for me to say I feel so far away Soon one of these days I'll be back home to stay
63,Again the Night,Against the Night,Jason Webley,"Hold on to these words,  This night won't last forever,  That's a promise.  This light won't die.   This light won't die.  Between the shadows of the leaves,  It dances.  As the wind goes by.

64,Against the Grain,Against the Grain,Bad Religion,"Three thousand miles of wilderness overcome by the flow A lonely restitution of pavement, pomp and show I seek a thousand answers, I find but one or two I maintain no discomfiture, my path again renewed  Against the grain, that's where I'll stay Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain  Here labeled as a lunatic, sequestered and content There ignored and defeated by the government There's an oriented public whose magnetic force will pull But away from the potential of the individual  Against the grain, that's where I'll stay Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain  The flow is getting stronger with small increments of time And eddies of new ideas are increasingly hard to find You need all that the other has, it's your right to seize the day But in all your acquisitions you will soon be swept away  Against the grain, that's where I'll stay Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain  There's a common consensus and an uncomfortable cheer A reverberating chorus that anyone can hear It sings 'leave your cares behind you, just grab tenaciously' This lulling sense of purpose will destroy us rapidly  Against the grain, that's where I'll stay Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain  Against the grain, against the grain Against the grain"
65,Against the Night,Against the Night,Jason Webley,"Hold on to these words,  I'd like to think that they may offer  Some protection,  Against the night.   Against the night,  Your life can feel transparent,  A reflection,  A trick of light.   So when sleep just won't come,  And you've got no occupation,  But nibbling at the fruit Of the melancholy tree,  Just hold on to these words,  Hold on to me.  Just hold on to these words, They're the best I've got to offer  At the moment, As a lullaby.  As a lullaby,  You can lay down by the tracks  And feel the world Slip by."

67,Ahab,The Graduate,MC Lars,"Call me Ahab, what, monomaniac Obsessed with success unlike Steve Wozniak On the hunt for this mammal that once took my leg With my warn down crew and my man Queequeg “You're never going to find him!” He's a big sperm whale “The ocean is enormous!” Shut up, we're setting sail This scar that you see that runs down my face Has scarred my soul and inspired this chase Mental sickness has got me on the run Full speed ahead! This is American fun There is wisdom that is woe, so welcome to my life It was fine until Moby scarred me like a knife Towards thee I sail, thou unconquering whale To stab my spear into your white tail The first one to stop him gets this gold doubloon Now excuse me while I go be melancholy in my room!  CHORUS (Got a low low feeling around me) Bad trip thanks to Moby Dick! (And a stone cold feeling inside) Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what! (And I just can't stop messing my mind up) Whale crash so fast (Or wasting my time) Oh no, oh no!

Grown up Beluga in the deep blue sea Swims so fast and swims so free With the heaven above, Moby Dick stressing me And this crazy drenched crew below Call it idiot pride, or call me Oedipus My main tragic flaw… “But what about us?” It's your battle too, crew, man vs. beast At least have respect as we sail south and east And north and west, look I'm doing my best While the rain keeps pouring we're exhausted and stressed Pip went insane when he almost drowned, So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown Random ships we met warned us of our doom They said our boat would be our tomb Near the Mariana Trench, deep and oceanic We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic  REPEAT CHORUS I said, “You took my leg, and for that you must die!” I threw my spear and hit Moby in the eye He charged the boat, it began to sink I said, “How about that? Hubris really stinks!” I didn't think that it would end like this Pride met fate, this captain got dissed Let it be a lesson, revenge is never sweet So I stomp my peg to this Supergrass beat!  REPEAT CHORUS  (Got a low low feeling around me) That's it, thanks to Moby Dick! (And a stone cold feeling inside) Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what! (And I just can't stop messing my mind up) Whale crash so fast (Or wasting my time) Oh no, oh no! The ship's got a hole, plug it up, plug it up!"

Things are really taking off for me business is thriving and I'm showing a profit and. And in any case it wouldn't be the same, cause we've all grown up and we've got our lives And the values that we had once upon a time, seem stupid now cause the rent must be paid And some bonds severed and others made.  Now I don't want you to get me wrong, ideals are fine when you are young and I must admit We had a laugh, but that's all it was and ever will be, cause the burning sky keeps Burning bright. and as long as it does (and it always will), there's no time for dreams When commerce calls. and the taxmans shouting cause he wants his dough and the wheels of Finance won't begin to slow.  And its only us realists who are gonna come through cause there's only one power higher Than that of truth and that's the burning sky.  Oh and by the way I must tell you, before I sign off, that I've got a meeting next week, With the head of a big corporate I can't disclose who but I'm sure you'll know it and. And the burning sky, keeps burning bright. and it won't turn off til its had enough, Its the greedy bastard who won't give up, and you're just a dreamer if you don't realize, And the sooner you do will be the better for you, then well all be happy and well all be Wise and all bow down to the burning sky.

537,Drag My Body,Exister,Hot Water Music,"Well I got my heart up in a beautiful mess, I should've known better when I took the risk, To wreck myself and to gamble while broke, Shaking something mental at a loss for the words I'd once known. I traded two steps forward for three steps back, To get to know the meaning of showing respect. I found the pedestals and burned them down, To kill my idols and to bury the thoughts underground. I'm no longer deaf to the sounds.  I'm hardly feeling human anymore, Enough to drag my body from the floor.  Well I got my head up in a critical mess, Fighting like a demon in a shell I possess. Gnashing my teeth and speaking in tongues, Still shaking something mental at a loss for the words I'd once known. Something's rattling my bones.  I'm hardly feeling human anymore, Enough to drag my body from the floor. I'm hardly feeling human anymore, Enough to drag my body from the floor.  Stand to hold steady now, Take a breath and somehow, Take a step to begin again, After all we can only do our best.  I'm hardly feeling human anymore, Enough to drag my body from the floor. I'm hardly feeling human anymore, Enough to drag my body from the floor.  Stand and hold steady now."

När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar jag vill nå, Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?  Jag når Örat (=Örebro), jag kör E 20 norr, det är stan I mitt hjärta av lycka och sorg, Men alla dom drömmar jag har, finns ej där Jag måste ta en chans I mitt liv, måste på det där tåget innan det går förbi, Men jag förblir passiv står kvar där jag är, Fast jag sagt till mig själv; jag gör det, jag svär Jag vet att det är tragiskt att inte leva så som man lär  Så säg att du förstår mig Säg att du känner dig lika liten som jag Säg att du förstår mig, och jag gör det idag  Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig? När ska jag våga vara mig själv, Så kanske att jag lever mitt liv för mig?"

I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star, The ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ Dying and drying as I rise tonight.  Isabella, we are rising. Isabella, we are rising"

But six feet off the highway, our bare legs stung with wheat, We'll dig a hole and bury all we could not defeat, and say that we'll stay for one more year. Bend to tie a shoelace, or bend against your fear, and say that you'll stay for one more year. With so much left to seek, the lease runs out next week."

Dreamed we were still going out.  Had that one a few times now.  Woke up to find we were not.  It's good to be awake.  Dreamed I was a tidal wave.  I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors.  Dreamed I was your landlord.  I showed your place when you had lovers.  If I was a vampire,  I wouldn't suck your blood.  Then I dreamed I was you.  Sweetest dream I have had.  If you could hear the dreams I've had, my dear,  They would give you nightmares for a week.  But you're not here and I can never sleep.  Come home so I can be a creep.  Dreamed I was a dream.  I stole you away in your sleep.  Saved you from a fire, a gun for hire,  I introduced you to a vampire.  A wave crashed on the beach.  We rolled around in its foamy grasp.  Kissing in the chaos of a kelpy sea.  Seems I couldn't save you from me.  Maybe I'm obsessive to think like this.  Probably not impressing you with my cheap tricks.  Honey, it's depressing  What depression does to some.  I'll play the part for hours  But I know you'll never come."

Concerned committees study and gen, the final word from Number Ten. The worried gasp a sigh and frown as all the walls come crashing down.

You'll learn that bad men dress in black and good men dress in white And the pamphlets in the playground say that's right And that girls were made for housework and boys were made to fight And the naughty pictures on page 3 make everything alright  And so from school to the outside world these morals you will take And unless you can reject them you'll have your mind at stake  They'll give you a decision when you get to 18, too The right to vote for someone else who says he cares for you But the only thing he cares about is getting to the top By conning you with empty words that promise you a lot But the end result is slavery to a false set of ideals You'll be tempted to believe them 'cause they'll seem so very real The slavery of attitudes that make you keep in line Subconsciously devoted to the morals of our time  And when you end up on the dole which you very likely will They'll offer you a brand new trade: Learning how to kill  Why don't you join the army? Be a man and not a fool There's someone else to think for you just like there was at school  They'll promise you absolution from the murders you'll commit In the name of god and country they can get away with it They fill you full of orders and promise you rewards Like busting up your family by sending you abroad A holiday in Germany or Iceland or Hong Kong Making money being useless well it seems it can't go wrong But then it's off to Northern Ireland where you'll practice what they preached You'll shoot to keep yourself alive and kill to keep the peace And then it won't be so much fun as you hear the wounded crying 'cause before they couldn't speak English and you didn't know what they were saying But when the children call you ""Bastard"" it will make you think again When you cannot tell the difference between animals and men  Animals don't wear uniforms but they kill as much as you But the army kills for money and animals kill for food It's the basest degradation in the name of what is right Become something you never were and regret it til you die  'cause your father will tell you ""Sonny, you must do as you are told"" And you'll say the same thing to your kids when you're 32 years old And unless you can react against the brainwash from the start Your government will rule your mind and your mind will rule your heart You'll conform to every social law and be the system's slave From birth to school to work to death, from the cradle to the grave"

But, it's deeper than This, I'm not the only one who sees, it Lies in Diversity; acceptance to a degree, only to a degree. The fire that Once occupied my eyes has spread to Destroy this world I have grown. You have Nothing New to scream beyond your fields and not a second of Patience to Learn from me the same. This time I Harvest the crops of my past. As far as The demigods Are concerned, I've sold myself out just the same. I've burned Bridges to feign brothers. Brothers of Nothing more than a simple label. So Now, I'm in Control after all, for myself I prove I still am. But Within these fields, they'll say I never was."

876,How Does It Feel?,Best Before 1984,Crass,"When you woke this morning you looked so rocky-eyed, Blue and white normally, but strange ringed like that in black. It doesn't get much better, your voice can get just ripped up shooting in vain, Maybe someone hears what you say, but you're still on your own at night. You've got to make such a noise to understand the silence. Screaming like a jackass, ringing ears so you can't hear the silence Even when it's there - like the wind seen from the window, Seeing it, but not being touched by it.  (We never asked for war, nor in the innocence of our birth were we aware of it. We never asked for war, nor in the struggle to realisation did we feel there was a need for it. We never asked for war, nor in the joyful colours of our childhood were we conscious of its darkness.)  HOW DOES IT FEEL? How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.  Your arrogance has gutted these bodies of life, Your deceit fooled them that it was worth the sacrifice. Your lies persuaded people to accept the wasted blood, Your filthy pride cleansed you of the doubt you should have had. You smile in the face of the death cause you are so proud and vain, Your inhumanity stops you from realising the pain That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.  You never wanted peace or solution, From the start you lusted after war and destruction. Your blood-soaked reason ruled out other choices, Your mockery gagged more moderate voices. So keen to play your bloody part, so impatient that your war be fought. Iron Lady with your stone heart so eager that the lesson be taught That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.  How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.  Throughout our history you and your kind Have stolen the young bodies of the living To be twisted and torn in filthy war. What right have you to defile those birth? What right have you to devour that flesh? What right to spit on hope with the gory madness That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.  How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.  You accuse us of disrespect for the dead, But it was you who slaughtered out of national pride. Just how much did you care? What respect did you have As you sent those bodies to their communal grave? You buried them rough-handed, they'd given you their all, That once living flesh defiled in the hell That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.  You use those deaths to achieve your ends still, Using the corpses as a moral blackmail. You say ""Think of what those young men gave"" As you try to bind us in your living death, Yet we do think of them, ice cold and silence In the snow covered moorlands, stopped by the violence That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.  How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?  1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - We don't want your fucking war! 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - We don't want your fucking war! 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - We don't want your fucking war! 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 You can stop your fucking war!"

In the basement? In the attic? In your room? Working some job? Just to have something to do? Just to have a place to put yourself? Just to have a way to get away from them A chance to get away from the ones who made you feel so strange and Ill-at-ease inside yourself Did you ever get invited to one of their parties? You sat and wondered if you would go or not For hours you imagined the scenarios that might transpire They would laugh at you If you'd know what to do If you would had the right things on If they' d notice you came from a different planet Did you get all brave in your thoughts? Like you were going to go in there and deal with it And have a great time Did you think that you might be the life of the party? That all these people were going to talk to you To find out that you were wrong That you had a lot of friends and you weren't so strange after all Did you end up going? Did they mess with you? Did they single you out? Did you find out you were invited because they thought you were so weird  Yeah, I think I know you You spent alot of time full of hate A hate as pure as sunshine A hate that saw for miles A hate that kept you up at night A hate that filled your every waking moment A hate that carried you for a long time  Yes, I think I know you You couldn't figure out what they saw in the way they lived Home was not home Your room was home A corner was home The place they weren't That was home  I know you You're sensitive and you hide cuz you fear getting stepped on one more time It seems that when you show a part of yourself  That is the least bit vulnerable someone takes advantage of you One of them steps on you They mistake kindness for weakness But you know the difference You've been the brunt of their weakness for years And strength is something you know a bit about Because you had to be strong to keep yourself alive  You know yourself very well you now And you don't trust people You know them too well  You try to find that special person Someone you can be with Someone you can touch Someone you can talk to Someone you wont feel so strange around And you found that they don't really exist You feel closer to people on movie screens  Yeah, I think I know you You spend a lot of time day dreaming And people have made comment to that affect Telling you that your self involved and self centered But they don't know do they? About the long night shifts alone About the years of keeping yourself company All the nights you wrapped your arms around yourself so you could imagine someone holding you The hours of indecision, self doubt, The intense depression The blinding hate the rage that made you stagger The devastation of rejection  Well, maybe they do know But if they do they sure do a good job of hiding it It astounds you how they can be so smooth How they seem to pass through life As if life itself was some divine gift And it infuriates you to watch yourself  With your apparent skill in finding every way possible to screw it up For you life is a long trip Terrifying and wonderful Birds sing to you at night The rain and the sun The changing seasons are true friends Solitude is a hard won allie Faithful and patient  Yeah I think I know you"

You sat and wondered if you would go or not For hours you imagined the scenarios that might transpire They would laugh at you If you'd know what to do If you would had the right things on If they' d notice you came from a different planet Did you get all brave in your thoughts? Like you were going to go in there and deal with it And have a great time Did you think that you might be the life of the party? That all these people were going to talk to you To find out that you were wrong That you had a lot of friends and you weren't so strange after all Did you end up going? Did they mess with you? Did they single you out? Did you find out you were invited because they thought you were so weird  Yeah, I think I know you You spent alot of time full of hate A hate as pure as sunshine A hate that saw for miles A hate that kept you up at night A hate that filled your every waking moment A hate that carried you for a long time  Yes, I think I know you You couldn't figure out what they saw in the way they lived Home was not home Your room was home A corner was home The place they weren't That was home  I know you You're sensitive and you hide cuz you fear getting stepped on one more time It seems that when you show a part of yourself  That is the least bit vulnerable someone takes advantage of you One of them steps on you They mistake kindness for weakness But you know the difference You've been the brunt of their weakness for years And strength is something you know a bit about Because you had to be strong to keep yourself alive  You know yourself very well you now And you don't trust people You know them too well  You try to find that special person Someone you can be with Someone you can touch Someone you can talk to Someone you wont feel so strange around And you found that they don't really exist You feel closer to people on movie screens  Yeah, I think I know you You spend a lot of time day dreaming And people have made comment to that affect Telling you that your self involved and self centered But they don't know do they? About the long night shifts alone About the years of keeping yourself company All the nights you wrapped your arms around yourself so you could imagine someone holding you The hours of indecision, self doubt, The intense depression The blinding hate the rage that made you stagger The devastation of rejection  Well, maybe they do know But if they do they sure do a good job of hiding it It astounds you how they can be so smooth How they seem to pass through life As if life itself was some divine gift And it infuriates you to watch yourself  With your apparent skill in finding every way possible to screw it up For you life is a long trip Terrifying and wonderful Birds sing to you at night The rain and the sun The changing seasons are true friends Solitude is a hard won allie Faithful and patient  Yeah I think I know you"

956,I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles,"Greatest Hits, Vol. 1",Cockney Rejects,"I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air, They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, Then like my dreams they fade and die. Fortune's always hiding, I've looked everywhere, I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air.  I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes, I'm building castles high. They're born anew, their days are few, Just like a sweet butterfly. And as the daylight is dawning, They come again in the morning!  I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air, They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, Then like my dreams they fade and die. Fortune's always hiding, I've looked everywhere, I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air.  When shadows creep, when I'm asleep, To lands of hope I stray! Then at daybreak, when I awake, My bluebird flutters away. Happiness, you seem so near me, Happiness, come forth and cheer me!  I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air, They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, Then like my dreams they fade and die. Fortune's always hiding, I've looked everywhere, I'm forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air."

(up there) I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor (in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee (on the screen) And I looked at johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame (in the heart of man) The waves were coming in like arabian stallions Gradually lapping into sea horses He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat (the spoon) And let it deep in (the veins) Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities It started hardening Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities It started hardening in my hand And I felt the arrows of desire  I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area (go rimbaud go rimbaud go rimbaud) And go johnny go and do the watusi, Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...

You speak of love and respect, but there is so much hate in your words. As soon as you disagree, the boundary lines are all lost and blurred.  Turn in that crooked smile, seething through gritted teeth.  You hide your true intentions, but they're crystal clear to me. Don't we all know that crossing a line in the sand will be what unites us? History lies in the palm of our hand. And if death comes knocking, you can tell him that I’m still around. 'Cos I’m here fighting til they break these walls to the ground and tear the flag down.

And if death comes knocking, you can tell him that I’m still around. 'Cos I’m here fighting til they burn these walls to the ground. And I’m here still fighting, the guns and cannons will sound.

Will you stand up for what's right or back down from the fight? Victory or death! Victory or death! You hide your true intentions but they're clear to me. Don't we all know that crossing a line in the sand will be what unites us? History lies in the palm of our hand. And if death comes knocking, you can tell him that I’m still around.

We'll play the theme from the Dinah Shore show.  Who wants to be Dinah Shore? Who's alter-ego is Dinah Shore?  Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn, yawn, yawn.  Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time.   I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland.  The night before we played at the Long Goodbye.  I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night.  A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night.  And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this  bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires,  everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid,  right. Well, they drove up to me  and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,""  and showered me with some water.  So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock.  Now, I waited, walked down about a block to  where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside,  and sure enough they drove around again.  They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's?"" I said,  ""I don't know"" and they squirted me again.  So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car.  They screeched to a halt in the parking lot of some department store,  who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer,  and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling,  ""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you,  you motherfucker.""  So I got in a phone booth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside,  held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door  to the phone booth. So they began charging the phone booth,  beating on it with their club, yelling,  ""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you,  you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them.  So, there was a crowd gathering by this time  and these kids were standing nearby and they said,  ""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out.  I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away.  I want to be be put away.  Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away.  Please put me away now.""  They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police.  The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks.  He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,""  throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back.  Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here?  It looks like we're going have to take him to jail  but we got to have the full story first""  So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole  Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah,  ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit,  the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right,  so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him.  I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit.  Let me kill him.""  So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home,  and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence.  And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerant Oregon?   Ray, are you done with your guitar yet? He isn't done yet.  So what else do you want to hear, I'm out of stories.  That's a true story, too. Just ask Bruce Loose"

Accept the fact that their death can prevent our fears. Not the plot of cowardice, but the birth of a saviour. Acceptance of a martyr's role. Extricate these demons from sight. Risking life and limb. Vigil martyr, set the foundation of tolerance at any extreme. Even the price of suicide. Even a price so high as this. The seas of love must part to act on their behalf. For while we weep, they still rape, raping our patience for change. Off the hook for feigned insanity, but not off the hook from the public.

1590,Race Against Time,City Baby Attacked By Rats,G.B.H.,"Put us on a life support machine from the day we're born, Didn't realise it was just our dawn. By the media we've been accepted, but in reality still rejected.  From the start it won't last, But now that's all in the past. Never admit to being wrong, Five years on and we're still going strong.  Given a year to pack up and die, Take the taking, run and hide. Said 'race against time', thought it was clever, Time is immortal and we're forever.  So five years on and we should be dead, New ideas in the same old head. Don't need help, don't need a tutor, You're our past and we're your future. It's a race against time, but whose racing ? 'Cus we've already won."

1622,Rebel Waltz,Sandinista!,The Clash,"I slept and I dreamed of a time long ago I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires, A song of the battle, that was born in the flames, And the rebels were waltzing on air.  I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz That was written to be danced on the battlefield I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl A voice that called ""Stand till we fall We stand till all the boys fall.""  As we danced came the news that the war was not won 5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun Through the heart of the camp Swept the news from the front A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food We knew the war could not be won.  So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun In a glade through the trees I saw my only one Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing. The song was an old rebel one.  As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise A voice began to call, stand till you fall The tune was an old rebel one."

1700,Royal Swan,The Chemistry of Common Life,Fucked Up,"Feathers collect from the milk and the bones of the dead, Expressions of lives passed away live on in their debt, The journey begins from the tail of a swan at the end, Tributes below color spaces above and the sun,  The weight of the world is measured in cells and specks that collect, The foundation compels the ladders of life to reflect and upraise, Reflections of prey charge the predator's gaze, Wearing the face of the quarry, it takes the swan, Shows the blood as a mask on its face, Expressing the water and milk in embrace, And the sun the flames of life extinguish And fire to impel the distinguished  Beyond the expired the spark is renewed As the torch is propelled, the swan song crescendo to bid death farewell, The journey ends with a swan at the top, The earth facing the sky as the ultimate sum of the lives That it chose to survive and shine Back at the sun to take the world between your bill (To leave enough and have your fill) To leave the water but drink the milk (To spin the wool with silk) To be a royal swan"

Siehst du die reale Welt, die ich seit Jahren Tag für Tag ertrage?  Nimm das Leben wie es ist  Als ein Geschenk von Gottes Gnaden Das man dem schlimmsten Feind nicht wünscht Doch täglich neu empfängt. Ist eure Schmerzgrenze erreicht Fängt bei mir Humor erst an. Ich gehe stets bis an mein Ende Weil ich gar nicht anders kann. Woran manch anderer zerbricht Daran geh ich erst richtig auf Ich bin das kranke Rad in eurer Welten, lauf!  Kannst du dein Leben nicht ertragen?  Sagst du zu allem ja und amen?  Dann ist es für dich höchste Zeit zu gehen!  Kannst du die Schmerzen nicht ertragen,   Die dir dein Schöpfer offenbart?  Dann ist es allerhöchste Zeit für dich den letzten Weg zu gehen! Wo ist jetzt der Erlösung Heil? Die Kreuzigung ist längst vorbei!  Empfang das Wort, das dir den Weg ins Dunkel weist! Kein Schmerz mehr keine Qual Und du fühlst dich nie mehr allein!  Die Hoffnung trägt dich weiter Bist schon so oft gescheitert  Bist du wirklich derart fest im Glauben und naiv?  Hör auf mich, wenn ich sage, Es kommen keine besseren Jahre  Und, dass dein Schicksal sich auch sicher nicht mehr dreht!  Ein neuer Tag, du bist am Ende Und wieder faltest du die Hände.  Noch scheint der Horizont verborgen, Den du bislang nie geseh'n.  Du liest die Zeilen deines Lebens, Die ich einst fürsorglich gegeben Verlogen ziert ein Lächeln voller Güte mein Gesicht."

Das weiß doch jedes Kind, Dass bei den Männern die Säcke Am produktivsten sind  Schön sein und ein bisschen obszön sein, Sagt die Frau zu dem Mann: „Hey Schatzi, was wollen wir mehr?“ „Reich sein“, denkt der Mann dann, Weil er ist Prospekteverteiler Und wär' gern Millionär  Und irgendwann haben sie das Licht gesehen, Es hatte sechzig Watt Seitdem zünden sie jeden Sonntag Eine Kerze in der Kirche an, Und sie beten, dass ihre Träume in Erfüllung gehen, Denn sie erwarten vom Leben nicht zu viel  Nur schön sein und ein bisschen obszön sein, Sagt die Frau zu dem Mann: „Hey Schatzi, wir brauchen nicht mehr!“ „Nur reich sein“, denkt der Mann dann, Weil er ist Prospekteverteiler Und wär' gern Millionär"

Step in time, agree to share this pain. Live or die now, but still we suffer just the same!  I took my share and then told her, ""I don't want more"" We spend our lives, then ask you, what was this for, We gave our time and still we came up short.  'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more. We save the worst excuse, but the best in store. Maybe now, we'll finally even the score. Are you counting? - do you even wanna know?  'Cause unknown, the streets are never-ending. Sinking down, with nothing to defend me. Lie and wait, for some small show of mercy. Questions change - but the answers always stay the same!  I took my share and then told her, ""I don't want more"" I fell so low, I touched the oceans floor. But what the hell are we searching for?!  'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more. We save the worst excuse, but the best in store. Maybe now, we'll finally even the score. Are you counting? - do you even wanna know?  She lies awake now, and cried a thousand rivers. The circumstance here, has led this child astray. This candle's fading, the dim light slowly withers. You ask for guidance, but I just look away...  I have nothing more to say.  So let me down, because they never believed in you. Seal this crown, and still we can see right through.  'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more. We save the worst excuse, but the best in store. Maybe now we'll finally even the score. 'Cause this is all I've got. And now there's nothing."

1839,Signals Over the Air,War All the Time,Thursday,"This is what you see when you look in my direction: Incandescent corsets draw eyes tight like wires. This is how it feels, Calling out but no one even hears  The signals that we send over the air Over the air Over the air Over the air.   When you say my name, I want to split it from your lips And hide like whispers in the rain. When you say my name, I want to stop it in your lungs And collect all of your blood to put in the radio.  Is this how it feels When you don't even fit into your own skin? And its getting tighter, Every day I'm getting smaller If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear.    There's no where to hide. They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio. There's no where to hide. They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on.  If I keep holding my breath, all of this will fade away. If you keep driving we'll be lying in the wreck. Changing the shape, Folding like an envelope to keep each other in. Shattered glass, broken looks, and mascara gets Washed away by windshield wiper blades.    There's no where to hide. They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio. There's no where to hide. They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio. That's where we hide The love and lies and sex, on the radio."

And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening, People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence.  ""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you."" But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made.

But I'm frightened for your children, And the life that we are living is in vain. And the sunshine we've been waiting for, Will turn to rain. When the final line is over, And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall. I can hide inside your sweet sweet love, For ever more. Listen to the tide slowly turning, Wash all our heartaches away.

Durch das Gedränge, Der Menschenmenge Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg Entlang der Gassen Zu den einen Terrassen Über die Brücke, bis hin zu der Musik. Wo alles laut ist, Wo alle drauf sind Um durchzudrehen. Wo die anderen warten, Um mit uns zu starten Und abzugehen.  An Tagen wie diese Wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit An Tagen wie diese Haben wir noch ewig Zeit Wünsch' ich mir Unendlichkeit  Das hier ist ewig, Ewig für heute Wir stehen nicht still, Für eine ganze Nacht. Komm' ich trag' dich, Durch die Leute Hab' keine Angst Ich gebe auf dich Acht. Wir lassen uns treiben, Tauchen unter, Schwimmen mit dem Strom. Drehen unsere Kreise, Kommen nicht mehr runter, Sind schwerelos.  An Tagen wie diese Wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit An Tagen wie diese Haben wir noch ewig Zeit In dieser Nacht der Nächte, Die uns so viel verspricht Erleben wir das Beste Kein Ende ist in Sicht  Kein Ende in Sicht Kein Ende in Sicht Kein Ende in Sicht  An Tagen wie diese Wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit An Tagen wie diese Haben wir noch ewig Zeit.

Loved the book but I hate the end, gained a lover but I lost a friend.  Straight to worst, from the best.  Nothing can fill that hole in my chest.""  It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about fall.  To make things worse, it all goes so fast and we try to hold on as they go past.

2102,The Raven,The Raven,Various Artists,"Once upon a midnight dreary As I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious Volume of forgotten lore While I nodded, nearly napping Suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping Rapping at my chamber door ""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered ""Tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more.""  Muttering I got up weakly Always I've had trouble sleeping Stumbling upright my mind racing Furtive thoughts flowing once more I, there hoping for some sunrise Happiness would be a surprise Loneliness no longer a prize Rapping at my chamber door Seeking out the clever bore Lost in dreams forever more Only this and nothing more  Hovering my pulse was racing Stale tobacco my lips tasting Scotch sitting upon my basin Remnants of the night before Came again Infernal tapping on the door In my mind jabbing Is it in or outside rapping Calling out to me once more The fit and fury of Lenore Nameless here forever more  And the silken sad uncertain Rustling of the purple curtain Thrilled me, filled me With fantastic terrors never felt before So that now, oh wind, stood breathing Hoping yet to calm my breathing ""'Tis some visitor entreating Entrance at my chamber door Some lost visitor entreating Entrance at my chamber door This it is, and nothing more.""  Deep into the darkness peering Long I stood there Wondering fearing Doubting dreaming fantasies No mortal dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken And the stillness gave no token And the only word there spoken Was the whispered name, ""Lenore."" This I thought And out loud whispered from my lips The foul name festered Echoing itself Merely this, and nothing more  Back into my chamber turning Every nerve within me burning When once again I heard a tapping Somewhat louder than before ""surely,"" said I Surely that is something at my iron staircase Open the door to see what threat is Open the window, free the shutters Let us this mystery explore Oh, bursting heart be still this once And let this mystery explore It is the wind and nothing more  Just one epithet I muttered as inside I gagged and shuddered When with manly flirt and flutter In there flew a stately raven Sleek and ravenous as any foe Not the least obeisance made he Not a minutes gesture towards me Of recognition or politeness But perched above my chamber door This fowl and salivating visage Insinuating with its knowledge Perched above my chamber door Silent sat and staring Nothing more  Askance, askew The self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear At this savage viscous countenance it wears Though you show here shorn and shaven And I admit myself forlorn and craven Ghastly grim and ancient raven Wandering from the opiate shores Tell me what thy lordly name is That you are not nightmare sewage Some dire powder drink or inhalation Framed from flames of downtown lore Quotes the raven, ""nevermore.""  And the raven sitting lonely Staring sickly at my male sex only That one word As if his soul in that one word He did outpour, ""pathetic."" Nothing farther than he uttered Not a feather then he fluttered Till finally was I that muttered as I stared Dully at the floor ""other friends have flown and left me Flown as each and every hope has flown before As you no doubt will fore the morrow."" But the bird said, ""never, more.""  Then I felt the air grow denser Perfumed from some unseen incense As though accepting angelic intrusion When in fact I felt collusion Before the guise of false memories respite Respite through the haze of cocaine's glory I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory To forget At once The base Lenore Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""  ""Prophet,"" said I, ""thing of evil Prophet still, if bird or devil By that heaven that bend above us By that God we both ignore Tell this soul with sorrow laden Willful and destructive intent How had lapsed a pure heart lady To the greediest of needs Sweaty arrogant dickless liar Who ascribed to nothing higher Than a jab from prick to needle Straight to betrayal and disgrace The conscience showing not a trace."" Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""  ""Be that word our sign of parting Bird or fiend,"" I yelled upstarting ""get thee back into the tempest Into the smoke filled bottle's shore Leave no black plume as a token Of the slime thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbroken Quit as those have quit before Take the talon from my heart And see that I can care no more Whatever mattered came before I vanish with the dead Lenore."" Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""  But the raven, never flitting Still is sitting silent sitting Above a painting silent painting Of the forever silenced whore And his eyes have all the seeming Of a demon's that is dreaming And the lamplight over him Streaming throws his shadow to the floor I love she who hates me more I love she who hates me more And my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow Nevermore"

Right in front of me I see the rest of me, I see the rest of my life. And so again I beg for that beating, and when received I won't release- It's so healing. Caged inside I hide myself from all life. I've cried one thousand times I don't want to be alone again. I want to know myself; I want to be your friend. I think I'd die without that feeling once again. I know I'd die without that feeling once again. I'd die without that feeling once again, I'd quit this all to have that feeling never end."

2175,Time Slips Away,Time Slips Away,Champion,"Four year of my life that I'm never getting back and it hurts so much to realize. The days, the years I can't never live again. Painstaking, heart broken, and filled with regret. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back but it's never coming back. And I thought I knew a better way. I'd lose myself in anything that could take away the pain. Years spent running and I never knew the cost. But shattered mirrors and broken hearts finally showed me what I'd lose. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back. We've all been lost before we've all been knocked to the ground. Let go of our regrets and find the strength to turn it around. I know it might seem far too late but we're just about to break these chains that have always held us back. We've made our own mistakes but now it's time to set it straight. And live our lives. Be who we need to be and let our hearts be free. Now we live our lives. Be who we need to be and let our hearts be free."

2225,Turn the Season,David Comes to Life,Fucked Up,"Things go up and then go down, chase a smile with a frown.  He knows that his joy will stop, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  He's a ship on the sea, setting sail to perfidy.  He is cold, he is warm, he's the peace inside the storm.  Feel the swelling of a wave, hear the ringing of a bell,  He's been weak and he's been brave, he's been to heaven and he's been to hell.  See the old in the new, see the life stretch before you,  See a mother in the child, there was youth behind grey eyes.  I don't know him anymore, he isn't like he was before.  A stone is taken by the tide, another season on the other side.  Like the spinning of a wheel, he'll be hurt but he will heal.   There's a flower in the weeds, there's a life inside the seed.  (And he said) ""I have never been as happy as I am today"",  (But then the seasons turned and the darkness came)  ""So when it all falls apart I will have peace in my heart""  (Try to think of the healing that comes out of the pain).  ""Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance"",  (The sun will always shine after the rain)  ""I know that when I fall down I'll get another chance""  (Just wipe away the tears and try again).   We couldn't see without the dark, thing's wouldn't end without a spark.  There is no truth without lies and no future without memories.  He's in the middle of the road, from where he's been and where he'll go.  He's the forest kissed by flames, the trees die so they can grow again.  He knows that death is part of life, he would have made that girl his wife.  Now there's only darkness, there is no dawn, now that she's gone.   (And he said) ""I have never been as happy as I am today"",  (but then the seasons turned and the darkness came)  ""So when it all falls apart I will have peace in my heart""  (Try to think of the healing that comes out of the pain).  ""Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance"",  (The sun will always shine after the rain)  ""I know that when I fall down I'll get another chance""  (Just wipe away the tears and try again)."

Reminding you to breathe It's only time before it catches up to you and all your broken luck I found a better way to get even with my enemies  That's it, we've had enough Please turn that fucking radio off Ain't nothing on the air waving the despair we feel That said, we've had enough Put ""Walk Among Us"" on and turn it up Ain't nothing on the air waving the hatred I feel  This is my biggest fear The only tunes that we hear Come via antenna through your car radio  That's it, we've had enough (we've had enough) That's it, we've had enough (we've had enough)"
2334,Weathered Statues,Thoughts of Yesterday 1981-1982,T.S.O.L.,"Weathered statues, tin soldiers that march in our parks Wrapped in yellowed newsprint, on their benches in the dark Faces fill with sadness, sorrow drawn from your nights Surviving on old glories but now the glory's have died Lonely men who are tortured, once proud but now forgotten Gnarled hands hold canes, where guns were once before Taunted by the children whose parent's lives he saved Forgotten by a state, whose leg in war he gave Silver gleams upon his chest, though sweat gleams on his brow Darker days and sable nights, who work upon his soul His honor flew away from him, like pigeons on the wind Spending his last pennies on cheap wine and sins But still they make the soldiers And soldiers still grow old Another day, another statue, falls out in the dawn Weathered Statues stil march on and on"

Away for years, and now you're here, So tell them where you've been. Wait in line, enjoy the ride. It's coming back again.  It's OK. You didn't even listen in the first place.

Es ist auch mein zuhaus', selbst wenn's ein Zufall ist Und irgendwann fällt es auch auf mich zurück, Wenn ein Mensch aus einem anderen Land Ohne Angst hier nicht mehr leben kann. Weil täglich immer mehr passiert, Weil der Hass auf Fremde eskaliert Und keiner weiß, wie und wann man diesen Schwachsinn stoppen wird.  Es ist auch mein Land, Und ich kann nicht so tun, als ob es mich nichts angeht. Es ist auch dein Land, Und du bist schuldig, wenn du deine Augen davor schließt.  Dies ist das Land, in dem so viele schweigen, Wenn Verrückte auf die Straße gehen, Um der ganzen Welt und sich selbst zu beweisen, Dass die Deutschen wieder die Deutschen sind. Diese Provokation, sie gilt mir und dir, Denn auch du und ich, wir kommen von hier. Kein Ausländer, der uns dabei helfen kann, Dieses Problem geht nur uns allein was an. Ich hab keine Lust, noch länger zuzusehen, Ich hab's satt, nur zu reden und rumzustehen, Vor diesem Feind werde ich mich nicht umdrehen.  Es ist auch mein Land, Und ich will nicht, dass ein viertes Reich draus wird. Es ist auch dein Land, Steh auf und hilf, dass blinder Hass es nicht zerstört. Es ist auch mein Land, Und sein Ruf ist sowieso schon ruiniert. Es ist auch dein Land, Komm wir zeigen, es leben auch andere Menschen hier."

You don't know where you're going, You don't know where you've been You don't know why But your life is a lie, It goes by like a dream You're stuck in this rat race, Your job drives you insane You live for the bribe Of the next pay-rise And a cut-prize holiday  You know you're getting older, It's not gonna stop You're locked inside a prison Where they bleed you drop by drop You wake up and you wonder Why bother getting out of bed You sold your soul to the corporate goal And you want a new life instead  Bang, bang you're dead There's a gun at your head! But it's only a game, if they shoot you down, You can get up and start again  Bang, bang you're dead But your blood's still running red If you look at your life with different eyes, You'll know how to start again  You can't break out of the circle, Your life's not going anywhere Nobody's going to help you, 'Cause none of them really care You could lose your life On a crowded street, They wouldn't even turn their heads It's all gone wrong, The pressure's too strong, Better get a new life instead  You don't know where you're going, You don't know where you've been You can open your eyes and the innocence dies And your past life is a dream Dead but your blood keeps pumping, Dead but your heart still beats You know why you're here, you know who you are And you know who you wanna be  Bang, bang you're dead There's a gun at your head! But it's only a game, if they shoot you down, You can get up and start again  Bang, bang you're dead There's a gun at your head! But it's only a game, if they shoot you down, You can get up and start again  Bang, bang you're dead! Bang, bang you're dead! So down on luck, it feels like nothing's enough, You should get a new live instead  Bang, bang you're dead But your blood's still running red If you look at your life but with different eyes, You'll know how to start again"
